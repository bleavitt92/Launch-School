Create a method that returs the sum of two integers

Name the method and have it's input be two integers
add two integers together
end 

START 
SET method as sum(x, y)
PRINT x+y
END

Create a method takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

START 
given a collections of strings in an array called array_of_string
SET method as stringy(array_of_string)
SET output_string = ''
iterate over each string within the array and add to output_string
PRINT output_string
END

Create a method that takes an array of integers and returns a new array with every other element

define the new array output as output = [] 
iterate over the array of integers and add the even indexed values to the output
return output

START
given an array of integers called array
SET output = []
SET index = 0
array.each do |num|
  if index.even?
    add num to output 
  elsif index.zero?
    add num to ouput
  end 
  output
END
